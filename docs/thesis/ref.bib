   abstract = {The Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF) is a suitable representation for the appearance of highly
               detailed surface structures under varying illumination and viewing conditions. Since real-time
               rendering of the full BTF data is currently not
               feasible, approximations of the six-dimensional BTF are used such that the amount of data is reduced
               and current graphics hardware can be exploited. While existing methods work well for materials with
               low depth variation, realism is lost if the depth variation grows.

               In this article we analyze this problem and devise a new real-time rendering paradigm based on
               linear interpolation of reflection fields, which provides significant improvements with respect to
               realism for such highly structured materials without
               sacrificing the general applicability and speed of previous algorithms. We propose real-time
               rendering algorithms for this new method supporting either point light sources or image-based
               lighting and demonstrate the capabilities of our new approach with several examples.},
